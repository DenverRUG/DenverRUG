**Quantified Self: R tools for the analysis of personal data to improve health**

https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/263490698/

JP Snow will be presenting.

*Abstract*

"Quantified Self" involves tracking personal data to improve fitness,
health and personal performance. The data and analytic packages available
in R make personal quantification even more valuable. Participants in this
session will learn how to create a personal dashboard and see how how
machine learning can be used to determine optimal sleep factors, all via R.
Other concepts to be covered will include:
- Flexdashboard package for dashboard development
- ggplot techniques, including ggplotly for more interactivity
- Accessing personal data directly from R into Fitbit’s web API
- Using scatter charts, box plots and decision tree methods for analysis

JP Snow has been involved in analytics roles in financial services
throughout his twenty-year career. He currently leads Institutional
Analytics & Client Loyalty at Charles Schwab. A few years ago he started
tracking fitness metrics and realized R had substantial advantages over
Excel. He also leads the Denver Quantified Self Meet-Up group.

* [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/263490698/)

### 2019 June 25

**Sparklyr: Connecting R and Apache Spark**

Ben Hoffman will be presenting an introduction to Sparklyr, an R package to
working with Apache Spark. Do you have data that is too big to fit into memory?
Spark will let you work in memory or on disk, cache tables in memory, and use
machine learning libraries on data that is too big to fit into memory!

### 2019 April 23

**knitr::spin -- A more dynamic approach to dynamic documents**

Building dynamic documents via literate programming is a critical part of
responsible and reproducible science. Built on a literature programming
framework, authoring .Rmd, .Rnw, .Rhtml, or other files, uses a markup language
(markdown, LaTeX, html, ...) as the primary language for the file and the
analysis/programming language (R, C++, SAS, ...) is a guest language. This
paradigm has been extremely useful and durable since its formal introduction in
the book "Literate Programming" Donald Knuth in 1984. R users should be at least
aware of Sweave and knitr::knit, two R focused literate programming tools.

However, the common method of literate programming is, from the perspective of
an analysis, backwards. As an analysis my primary language is the analysis
language and the human readable report is nothing more than detailed code
comments about the analysis script(s). knitr::spin is the tool needed to use
literate programming paradigms where the analysis language is the primary
language for the file(s) and the markup language is the guest language.

This talk will cover the following:

1. Introduction to knitr::spin -- concept and syntax
2. Simple reports -- that is analysis.R --> analysis.(docx|html|pdf)
3. Non-trivial reports -- child documents and conditional code evaluation

* [Slides and Examples](https://github.com/DenverRUG/2019-04-23-spin)
* [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/260632409/)

### 2018 November 13

1. You down with NLP? (yeah you know me)<br>Richard Vlasimsky with IMIDEX will
   demonstrate some basic natural language processing concepts and techniques in
   R using data from the Open Lyrics database on Github.

2. Spark and sparklyr<br> Sean Lopp from Rstudio will go through how to get
   started with Spark and sparklyr. We'll also discuss what Spark is and where
   its used, and demo examples of data wrangling, machine learning, and spark
   streaming.

* [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/255628505/)

### 2018 October 9
Two talks:

**R + TensorFlow: GPU-Accelerated Computing in the Age of Deep Learning**
by Matt Hergott

Today’s complex neural networks and large data sets make it difficult or
impossible to solve problems with traditional computational methods. This talk
will focus on how we can use R with TensorFlow and graphics processing units
(GPUs) to achieve our goals in a dramatically accelerated fashion.

Topics covered include: What is GPU computing? Why do we use libraries like
TensorFlow? What is the relationship between TensorFlow and Keras? What does an
R + TensorFlow program look like?

Matt Hergott focuses on traditional econometric analysis, deep learning
architectures, and complex quantitative visualizations through his firm MiaBella
AI. His GPU programming experience includes the emerging field of 3D holograms,
and a statistical visualization package he wrote made Microsoft’s top-16 list of
“noteworthy HoloLens content.”

**data.table package**

by David Heisler

This talk provides an overview of the data.table package including a brief
history of data.table, basic and some advance syntax and a comparison with
dplyr.

* [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/255157224/)

### 2018 September 11
Two talks:

**CausalImpact Package**
Karen Kazor - Oracle Data Cloud

CausalImpact is a package contributed by the folks at Google to estimate the
effect of a treatment or intervention on a individuals observed over time. In
online advertising a common example is estimating additional clicks or other
actions attributed to a campaign. Karen will discuss some of the ins and outs of
this package.

**Hans Rosling - Truthfulness and googleVis**
Matt Pocernich - Oracle Data Cloud

Inspired by Hans Rosling's book - Factfulness, I will re-visit the googleVis
package which was inspired by the very cool animated plots used in his 2006 Ted
Talk. This talk will illustrate some the topics from recent book using goolevis
and ggplot.

Question for discussion: When and why do you use R Notebooks in lieu of
traditional Markdown documents?

* [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/253570063/)

### 2018 February 13

**R package development**

Peter DeWitt will be presenting. The focus will be on reproducible reporting,
documenting, and collaboration. The presentation will first show that relying on
a script is insufficient for sharing code and having reproducible results. The
movement from `important-analysis.R` script to an R package will be shown.

Expanding on the R package structure, Peter will provide examples of when
version control and continuous integration tools not only provide for higher
quality documentation and work, but can be essential for keeping each developer
on a team accountable.

We will cover SVN and Git log and blame. Using the testthat package, and using
CI.

### 2017 March 28

**RStudio Tidyverse**

Speakers : Sean Lopp and friends from Rstudio

At RStudio we think about a model for data science that begins with importing
and tidying data, continues with an iterative cycle of transforming, modelling,
and visualizing data, and ends with communicating results. We've built tools and
packages to help you succeed across this cycle: RStudio and Notebooks for
interactive development, the Tidyverse for making data science easier and more
effective, and R Markdown, Shiny, and the new RStudio Connect (Pro) for
communicating results. In this talk we'll share the way we think about data
science and our toolchain.

Refreshments kindly provided by Rstudio

All of the slides and demos are available at: https://github.com/rstudio/meetup_roadshow

### 2017 February 20

**Dave Robinson on tidytext**

Title: Tidy Text Mining with R

Abstract: Text data is increasingly important in many domains, but it can be
challenging to manipulate and visualize within typical R analysis workflows. In
this talk, I will introduce the tidytext package and show how tidy data
principles and tools can make text mining easier and more effective, by
structuring text as one-token-per-row. You'll learn how to manipulate,
summarize, and visualize text's characteristics using R packages from the tidy
ecosystem such as dplyr, ggplot2, and tidyr. You'll see case studies of
sentiment analysis, tf-idf, and topic modeling applied to examples from
literature, Twitter, and Stack Overflow questions, and gain the tools to draw
conclusions from your own text datasets.

Bio: David Robinson is a Data Scientist at Stack Overflow, where he analyzes
data on the world's software developers to help them find answers to their
programming questions. He is the co-author with Julia Silge of the tidytext
package and of the upcoming book Text Mining with R, to be published by O'Reilly
in 2017. He is also the author of the broom, gganimate, and fuzzyjoin packages
and of the DataCamp course "Exploratory Data Analysis in R: Case Study." He
writes about R, statistics and education on his blog Variance Explained, as well
as on Twitter as @drob.

   cluster on a personal computer, some of the more useful analysis features of
   SparkR for parallel computing, and different options for scaling your
   development cluster to the cloud.

1. **GPU Computing in R** A Focus on the gpuR Package Matt Hergott

1. **foreach and rxExec** Michael Helbraun - Revolutions Analytic.  Generally, R
   is in memory and single threaded. To scale to larger data and/or more
   computationally intensive problems parallelization becomes important; this
   talk will mostly cover options for explicit (foreach, rxExec)
   parallelization, but we'll also touch upon some options for implicit
   parallelization as well.

### 2016 June 8

**Data Visualization**

1. **R Powered Dashboards - within the Microsoft Ecosystem**
   - Phil Wagner - The Cadmus Group
   - As Microsoft integrates R into an increasing number of applications, it
     adds to the ways in which R can be used to simplify data processing and
     sharing… Even within the MS ecosystem. This presentation will show an
     example of using R with Power BI to quickly create and share interactive
     dashboards that visualize key information in real-time.

2. **flexdashboard: Easy interactive dashboards for R**
   - Sean Lopp from R Studio will present on a new package for creating HTML dashboards in R Markdown.
   - flexdashboard
     (https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/aebd1958-7160-4855-9298-d6fbe43a128e/rmarkdown-rstudio-com-flexdashboard)
     provides a handful of dashboard layouts configured with simple syntax, the
     barrier to entry couldn't be lower!

3. **(Time permitting) The logic behind ggplot2**
   - Matt Pocernich - Oracle
   - Frequently, new users of ggplot2's initial reaction to the package and the
     relatively complex syntax is "WTF?, Why can't I just do whatever I want?"
     This talk briefly looks in to the underlying logic behind ggplot graphics
     as discussed by Wilkinson in The Grammar of Graphics and Wickam's book:
     ggplot2.  Wilkonson introduces the logic and structure behind translating
     mathematical ideas into graphics. This is the rigor behind many of the
     seemingly inflexible features found in ggplot.
