### 2019 November 19

**Reactivity in Shiny Aps**

Kyle Bartsch, @kbartsch, presented on the various ways to configure and debug
reactivity in Shiny apps, from simple user input to dynamic user interaction
with data tables and plots.

* [Slides and Examples](https://github.com/DenverRUG/DRUG-Shiny-Demos)
* [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/265318284/)

### 2019 October 22

**Two Talks**

1. Matt Pocernich, @mjpdenver, presented on regular expressions, grep, and
   sub in R.

2. Peter DeWitt, @dewittpe, presented on building and using R data packages
   for data sets which are larger than memory. Applications for this type of
   work can include large static data sets and/or collaboration when a central
   data base is not an option.

### 2019 September 24

**Propensity Score Methods**

Office Hours (minutes). Want to pose a question to the group that can be
addressed in a few minutes? Please do.

Propensity Score Methods using R. (Matt Pocernich at Oracle Data Cloud)

With a brief overview of the concepts behind propensity scores methods, this
talk will look at several R packages, such as hdPS, twang and Zelig, focusing on
twang (Toolkit for weighting and analysis of non-equivalent groups ) . This talk
was inspired by the Advanced Topics in Propensity Score Methods workshop by Wei
Pan, Duke University; Haiyan Bai, University of Central Florida taught at this
year’s JSM.

magrittr : A basic introduction to the piping operators provided by the
magrittr. (Also by Matt Pocernich - unless someone else would like to speak on
this topic. )

### 2019 August 6

**Quantified Self: R tools for the analysis of personal data to improve health**

https://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/263490698/

JP Snow will be presenting.

*Abstract*

"Quantified Self" involves tracking personal data to improve fitness,
health and personal performance. The data and analytic packages available
in R make personal quantification even more valuable. Participants in this
session will learn how to create a personal dashboard and see how how
machine learning can be used to determine optimal sleep factors, all via R.
Other concepts to be covered will include:
- Flexdashboard package for dashboard development
- ggplot techniques, including ggplotly for more interactivity
- Accessing personal data directly from R into Fitbit’s web API
- Using scatter charts, box plots and decision tree methods for analysis

JP Snow has been involved in analytics roles in financial services
throughout his twenty-year career. He currently leads Institutional
Analytics & Client Loyalty at Charles Schwab. A few years ago he started
tracking fitness metrics and realized R had substantial advantages over
Excel. He also leads the Denver Quantified Self Meet-Up group.
